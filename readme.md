## Implementation of a Conic Based Pose Determination Algorithm 

To reconstruct the pupil pose in a stereo eye tracking system like proposed in [1] and estimate gaze from two pupil ellipse representations in two camera images Song De Ma [2] proposed a conic based pose determination algorithm, which is reimplemented in pure numpy within this repository.

I used the algorithm in [1] for gaze estimation in a stereo camera setup.

The implementation with explanations can be found in  Stereo_Reconstruction_De_Ma.ipynb
